### Current Analysis of Marketing Strategy for E-commerce Fashion (Women's Apparel)  
  
**Identified Weaknesses:**  
1. **Limited Engagement on Secondary Platforms:** The current strategy relies heavily on Instagram and TikTok but lacks strong utilization of Google Shopping and Email. The average engagement rate on Instagram can be enhanced; currently at around 2% from the inferred data.
  
2. **High Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** With CAC not provided but inferable through revenue and conversion rates, implementing stricter tracking could highlight inefficiencies. Comparatively, industry benchmarks for CAC in E-commerce fashion are generally around $30-$50, indicating potential misalignment.

3. **Suboptimal Conversion Rates:** Average conversion rate is around 3.1% (2539 conversions from 82594 sessions). This is below the industry standard for E-commerce fashion which can be above 4%. This indicates a need for refinement in the conversion funnel.

4. **Underutilized Email Marketing Potential:** Email, often seen as a cost-effective channel, is underutilized. Given that email marketing has a ROI of $42 for every dollar spent, optimizing this channel would be a strategic improvement. 

5. **Seasonal and Trend Response:** Trends in women's fashion can shift rapidly. The absence of a dynamic content strategy that aligns with real-time trends likely inhibits potential revenue.
