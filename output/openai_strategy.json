  "strategy_text": "This marketing strategy for a Fashion E-commerce business targets women aged 25-45, specifically urban professionals who are fashion-conscious. The overarching goal is to transform current challenges into sustainable growth by optimizing customer acquisition costs (CAC), significantly increasing customer lifetime value (CLTV) and repeat purchase rates, and diversifying marketing channels to mitigate seasonal revenue fluctuations and platform-specific risks. We will achieve this through a multi-channel, mobile-first approach emphasizing personalization, community building, and performance-driven ad spend, all while aiming for a robust return on ad spend (ROAS) and stable monthly revenue growth beyond the current ~$1.5M.",

    "Declining organic reach on Instagram due to algorithm changes, impacting reliance on a single major channel.",
