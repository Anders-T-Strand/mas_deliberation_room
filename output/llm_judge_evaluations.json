    "reasoning": {
      "creativity": "The strategy includes some interesting tactics such as TikTok expansion and user-generated content amplification, which are relevant to the target audience and demonstrate a degree of creativity. However, the overall approach remains largely standard for the e-commerce industry, lacking truly novel elements or innovative positioning that would elevate it to a higher score.",
      "actionability": "The strategy lacks specific actionable recommendations, as all tactics are listed without any details on implementation, timelines, or responsibilities. The absence of clear next steps makes it difficult to determine what actions should be prioritized or how to begin executing the strategy.",
      "relevance": "The strategy demonstrates a reasonable alignment with the target audience of women aged 25-45, particularly with its focus on urban fashion, which is relevant to this demographic. However, the lack of specific details on the tactics and their execution limits the depth of relevance, as it does not fully address the unique needs and preferences of the audience or the nuances of the e-commerce industry.",
      "strategic_coherence": "The strategy presents some logical gaps and inconsistencies, particularly in the lack of detailed explanations for the recommended tactics and their alignment with the identified weaknesses. While there are clear performance targets, the absence of specific implementation details and the undefined ROI for each tactic creates uncertainty in how these elements will cohesively work together to achieve the stated goals.",
      "practical_feasibility": "The strategy presents ambitious targets for revenue and customer engagement metrics without a clear outline of resource allocation or implementation phases. The lack of detailed tactics and budget breakdown raises concerns about practicality and risk awareness, suggesting that some practical concerns have not been adequately addressed."
